# FRI Proof Optimal Folding Strategy
This project seeks to find the optimal folding strategy for a FRI proof, using a heuristic to estimate the proof size in terms of field elements. The aim is to identify the strategy that results in the smallest estimated proof size.

# Overview
Given a polynomial of a specific degree and other parameters like the blowup factor and the number of queries, the objective is to compute the optimal folding strategy that minimizes the FRI proof size. The solution employs a recursive approach.
